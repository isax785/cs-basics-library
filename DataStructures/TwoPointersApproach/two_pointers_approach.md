# Two Pointers Approach

For questions where weâ€™re trying to find a subset, a set of elements, or something in a **sorted array**, the 2 pointers approach is useful.

These kind of problems usually involve two pointers:

- One slow-runner and the other fast-runner: a classic example is to remove duplicates from a sorted array)
- One pointer starts from the beginning while the other pointer starts from the end: they move toward each other until they both meet.

**Sliding windows** are also a subtype of 2 pointers, where we use them to expand or shrink the window with a condition. 

Here below some examples for the 2-pointers approach application.

- [ ] `#i` implement a `nodes_linked-list` system in `C++` to test the codes below.

## General Code Template

General code template for solving a 2 pointer approach problem of the second type:

```cpp
/* General two pointer problem solution */
public boolean twoSumProblem(int A[], int N, int X)
{
    // represents first pointer
    int left = 0;
    // represents second pointer
    int right = N - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        // question condition match
        if(){
            // do something
            return true
        }
        // first wrong condition
        else if(){
            // close in the array from left
            left+=1;    
        }
        // second wrong condition
        else{
            // close in the array from right
            right-=1;
        }
    }
}
```

## Remove Duplicates 

Sample code in `C++` that removes the duplicates in a sorted array.

```cpp
int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size()==0) return 0;
        int slow = 0;
        for (int fast = 1; fast < nums.size(); fast++) {
            if (nums[slow] != nums[fast]) {
                slow++;
                nums[slow] = nums[fast];
            }
        }
        return slow + 1;
    }
```

## Middle of the Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

```cpp
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        if(head->next == nullptr) return head;
        ListNode* slow=head;
        ListNode* fast=head;
        while(fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
```
